// This schema defines the Protobuf messages used for communication with the
// Cube Order Service (Osmium, OS).
//
// ### Connection
//
// The order service exposes a websocket endpoint for clients to connect to.
// Once connected, clients should submit a [`Credentials`](#credentials)
// message, listen for [`Bootstrap`](#bootstrap) messages for resting orders
// and positions, and then can begin submitting
// [`OrderRequest`](#order-request) and processing
// [`OrderResponse`](#order-response).
//
// ### Heartbeats
//
// Application-level heartbeats are expected every 30 seconds. If more than one
// interval is missed, the order service will disconnect the websocket.
//
// ### Price, Quantity, and Lots
//
// All orders are placed on a single market, specified by the market-id. The
// market definition specifies the base and quote assets and their respective
// lot sizes for the particular market. Prices and quantities in this API are in
// units of base and quote _lots_. That is, a quantity of 1 equals 1 base lot,
// and a price of 10 equals 10 quote lots / base lot (read as quote lots per
// base lot).
//
// For example, consider an ETHBTC market. ETH is the base asset and BTC is the
// quote asset. ETH has 18 decimal places (`1 ETH = 10^18 WEI`) and BTC has 8
// decimal places (`1 BTC = 10^8 SAT`). Suppose that in this example, the ETHBTC
// market has a base lot size of `10^15` and a quote lot size of `10^0` (`1`).
// Then an order placed with `quantity = 230` and `price = 6300` in
// market-agnostic terms is an order for `0.23 ETH` at a price of `0.06300 BTC /
// ETH`. In more detail, we have:
//
// ```text
// 230 base lots
//   * (10^15 WEI / base lot)
//   / (10^18 WEI / ETH)
//   = 230 ETH
//
// 6300 quote lots / base lot
//   * (1 SAT / quote lot)
//   / (10^15 WEI / base lot)
//   * (10^18 WEI / ETH)
//   / (10^8 SAT / BTC)
//   = 0.06300 BTC / ETH
// ```
//
// ### Exchange Order ID
//
// Each order is assigned a unique ID by the exchange. This order ID is
// consistent across modifies (including cancel-replace), and other operations.
// The exchange order ID can be used to find a particular order in the
// market-by-order market data feed, which allows the determination of FIFO
// queue priority, etc.
//
// ### Transact Time
//
// The transact time is the matching engine timestamp for when an event is
// processed. Events that occur with the same transact time occur atomically
// from the perspective of the matching engine.
